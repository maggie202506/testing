It allows multiple users at the remote site to access resources on the main office network as if they were directly connected to it. Please follow the steps below to set up an IPSec (site-to-site) VPN connection.</p> <p>STEP 1. Get both Routers in the Headquarter and Branch Office ready.</p> <p>1) Make sure both Routers are connected to the Internet, but two network can not be in the same LAN segment.  For example, if the headquarter is in the LAN segment 192.168.10.0/24, then the branches    should be in a different LAN segment, say, 192.168.20.0/24.</p> <p>2) Check and note down the WAN and LAN IP addresses of the Headquarter Router and Branch Office Router on their management Status page. WAN IP of the headquarters router is the remote gateway of the branch offices, and its LAN IP is the remote subnet of the branch offices; and vice versa.</p> <p>STEP 2: Configure the IPSec VPN on the Router in the Headquarter.</p> <p>1) Log into the Router A\u2019s management web page https://cudy.net (or 192.168.10.1). </p> <p>2) Go to General Settings -&gt;VPN. Enable VPN, and select IPSec (site-to-site) as Protocol. </p> <p>3) Click Add to add IPSec Policies.</p> <p>IPSec-Policy Settings</p> <ul> <li>Policy Name: Name the policy as desired. </li> <li>Remote Gateway: Enter the WAN IP of the Router in branch office.</li> <li>Local Subnet: Auto-filled the LAN segment of the local router.</li> <li>Remote Subnet: Enter the LAN segment of the Router in branch office.</li> <li>Preshared key: Set an encryption key as desired.</li> </ul> <p>Dead Peer Detection</p> <ul> <li>Dead Peer Detection: Enable to detect whether the peer end is alive or not;</li> <li>Check Interval: Keep 30 seconds as default or change as needed;</li> <li>DPD Timeout: Set when to perform PDP checking again.
